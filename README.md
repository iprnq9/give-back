Welcome

Give Back is a non-profit organization dedicated to providing inspiration for children to learn. We connect people, ideas, and (most importantly) knowledge. Community members that have experience in an area can find ways to teach the younger generation about this area. Whether that experience be formal education or work experience, we encourage you to give back what someone invested in you. With workshop topics ranging from math and science to wood-working and painting, we hope you find a way to Give Back.

How It Works

There are two parties that Give Back aims to connect: volunteers and opportunities to volunteer. The idea started with Ian wanting to host a math workshop after school for elementary students, but didn't know what schools had opportunities to do such. He noticed that in his college town, there are many smart people (students and professors) that could take time to volunteer at local schools to help inspire children to learn math and science. After that Give Back was created to facilitate community members to give back to the younger generation by providing fun, educational, and inspiring workshops.

Let's say a John Smith Elementary School has an idea for a workshop called "Science is Fun" where their students stay after school once a week for an hour to do experiments and see how cool science is. In order to find someone to host this workshop, John Smith Elementary School would create an account and post the workshop and its details on Give Back's website. From here, community members can find this workshop and if they think they could help out by voluntarily hosting it for the school, community members can contact with John Smith Elementary School, where the two parties can decide on the further details.

Now let's say that Bob Jones, a community member, has an idea for a math workshop called "Math is Awesome", but doesn't know where to host it. He can post the workshop details on Give Back where he will be credited as the author. If John Smith Elementary School is looking for a math workshop, they can get on Give Back and search for local workshops that focus on math for elementary students. If John Smith Elementary School comes across "Math is Awesome" and likes the idea, they can contact its author, Bob Jones. From there the two parties can decide how to arrange the workshop!

Get Started

To get started, simply create an account, start searching for workshops, and get involved in hosting them in your community! It's all about connecting people and ideas so please post your ideas and search for others, and when you see an opportunity to host it, go for it!

Our Mission

Give Back's mission has and will continue to be to connect community members with opportunities to volunteer, especially in ways that inspire children to learn math and science.

Not only do we want to connect people, but we want to connect ideas. Every user will be able to see what sorts of workshops others have hosted and have created. The details of each workshop outline the length of the workshop, the intended age group, materials used, and other information so that any person that views this workshop could host it wherever they
